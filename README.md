Steps:

1. Initialize the game board: Use a 3x3 char array to represent the board.
2. Display the board: Create a method to print the board in its current state.
3. Handle player moves: Allow players to input their moves and place their symbol ('X' or 'O').
4. Check for a winner or a draw: Implement logic to determine if there's a winner or the game ends in a draw.
5. Loop until the game ends: Continue the game until a player wins or the board is full.
